This is the third solo project I built learning React

This meme generator calls an the imgflip API to store an array of meme templates, then utilizes React.useState and React.useEffect as well as user inputs to generate a meme. Users can type in a "top text" and a "bottom text" to add texts to the template, or click the button to randomly get another meme template

*the top and bottom text will not be suitable for all meme templates.
